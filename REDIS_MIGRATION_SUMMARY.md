# Redis Migration Summary

## Summary of Completed Work

The application has been successfully migrated from PostgreSQL to Redis as the primary database. This migration involved:

1. **Core Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Updated environment variables to use Redis
   - Created a Redis client and database service layer
   - Implemented Redis adapter for NextAuth authentication
   - Created verification and email services using Redis

2. **API Routes**:
   - Updated key API routes to use Redis instead of PostgreSQL:
     - User registration (/api/register/route.ts)
     - Profile browsing (/api/profiles/route.ts)

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Created and ran migration scripts to import data from PostgreSQL to Redis
   - Implemented verification scripts to confirm data integrity
   - Created database service layer for consistent Redis operations

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Removed PostgreSQL/Drizzle dependencies from package.json
   - Updated database service to remove PostgreSQL code paths
   - Created script to identify remaining PostgreSQL references

## Data Structure in Redis

The Redis implementation uses the following data structures:

### Users
- **Key Pattern**: `user:{id}`
- **Structure**: Hash containing user data
- **Index**: Set `users` containing all user IDs

### Profiles
- **Key Pattern**: `profile:{id}` (currently uses same ID as user)
- **Structure**: Hash containing profile data
- **Index**: Set `profiles` containing all profile IDs

### Interests
- **Key Pattern**: `interest:{id}`
- **Structure**: Hash containing interest data
- **Indexes**:
  - Set `interests` containing all interest IDs
  - Set `user:{id}:interests:sent` for interests sent by a user
  - Set `user:{id}:interests:received` for interests received by a user

### Shortlists
- **Key Pattern**: `user:{id}:shortlist`
- **Structure**: Set containing IDs of shortlisted users

### Notifications
- **Key Pattern**: `notification:{id}`
- **Structure**: Hash containing notification data
- **Index**: Set `user:{id}:notifications` for a user's notifications

### Verification Codes
- **Key Pattern**: `verification:{email}:{purpose}`
- **Structure**: Hash containing verification data
- **Expiration**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)

## Remaining Work

1. **API Routes to Update**:
   - See `POSTGRES_REFERENCES_REPORT.md` for a complete list of API routes that still use PostgreSQL
   - Use the patterns established in the updated routes as a guide

2. **Testing**:
   - Test all authentication flows
   - Test profile operations (create, update, search)
   - Test social features (interests, shortlists)
   - Test notifications system

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md to reflect Redis infrastructure
   - Document Redis backup and maintenance procedures
   - Document deployment requirements for Redis

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Archive or remove PostgreSQL schema files
   - Clean up or archive migration scripts that are no longer needed
   - Remove any remaining direct PostgreSQL imports or references

## Benefits of Redis Migration

1. **Performance**:
   - Faster data access with in-memory operations
   - Reduced latency for common operations

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Simpler data model without complex SQL schema
   - Easier operations and maintenance

3. **Scalability**:
   - Better handling of traffic spikes
   - Simpler scaling through Upstash Redis

4. **Cost**:
   - Predictable cost structure based on usage
   - No ongoing database maintenance costs

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Add Redis Backup Strategy**:
   - Implement regular Redis exports of key data
   - Store backups securely

2. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for Redis connection and performance
   - Create alerts for Redis connection failures

3. **Optimize Queries**:
   - Review and optimize frequent Redis operations
   - Consider adding secondary indexes for common queries

4. **Further Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove or archive all PostgreSQL-related code
   - Further simplify Redis data access patterns
