# Cloudinary Credentials Fix

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing a "Must supply api_key" error in the production environment when attempting to upload photos to Cloudinary. This error occurred because environment variables were not being properly loaded in the production API routes.

## Root Cause
In Next.js API routes, environment variables are sometimes not properly available in production deployments, especially in serverless environments like Vercel. This can happen due to:

1. Environment variables not being properly exposed to API routes
2. Edge function limitations in serverless environments
3. Differences between build-time and runtime environment variable access

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a robust solution with multiple layers of fallbacks:

1. **Added Multiple Environment Variable Formats**:
   - Added both regular and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables in `next.config.mjs`
   - This ensures the variables are available in both client and server contexts

2. **Added Hardcoded Fallbacks in Key Files**:
   - Added hardcoded fallback values in `cloudinary-service.ts` and API routes
   - These fallbacks will be used if environment variables fail to load

3. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging in the API routes and service to show which credential sources are being used
   - This helps diagnose issues in different environments

## How to Maintain

When updating Cloudinary credentials, make sure to:

1. Update them in the Vercel project settings through the dashboard
2. Update the `.env` and `.env.local` files for local development
3. If the hardcoded fallbacks are used, update them in:
   - `lib/cloudinary-service.ts`
   - `app/api/profiles/upload-photo/route.ts`
   - `app/api/profiles/upload-photos/route.ts`

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix is working:

1. Test local development by uploading photos
2. Test the production deployment by uploading photos
3. Check the Cloudinary dashboard to confirm the uploads were successful
4. Look for any "Must supply api_key" errors in the console logs

If errors persist after deployment, check the Vercel logs to see which credential source is being used.

## Security Considerations

The hardcoded fallback values are a pragmatic solution to ensure availability, but it's not ideal from a security perspective. In a future update, consider:

1. Using Vercel's environment configuration to ensure variables are properly loaded
2. Implementing a more secure secret management solution
3. Rotating API keys periodically
4. Setting appropriate permissions on the Cloudinary account
