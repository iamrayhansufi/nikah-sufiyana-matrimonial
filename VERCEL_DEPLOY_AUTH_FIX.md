# Vercel Deployment Authentication Fix

## Problem
Users were being redirected to the login page after registration instead of being authenticated and sent to the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated NextAuth Cookie Configuration
- Removed hardcoded `.vercel.app` domain to let NextAuth use the default cookie domain
- This helps with multi-domain Vercel deployments and preview URLs

### 2. Improved Domain Handling in Middleware
- Added safer parsing of NEXTAUTH_URL
- Added better support for Vercel preview URLs
- Fixed potential errors in hostname comparisons

### 3. Enhanced Registration Flow
- Added full URL generation for callbackUrl to ensure proper redirects
- Used absolute URLs to avoid relative path issues in production

### 4. Improved Login Flow
- Ensured consistent behavior with registration by using absolute URLs
- Fixed callback handling to maintain session state

### 5. Enhanced Redirect Callback
- Added more robust URL parsing with error handling
- Created an allowlist of safe origins and paths
- Improved handling of preview URLs

### 6. Enhanced Debug Endpoint
- Added more detailed session/cookie debugging info
- Added environment variable validation
- Added request URL analysis to help with troubleshooting

## Requirements for Vercel

Ensure these environment variables are set in the Vercel Dashboard:

1. `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string
2. `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - A secure random string used for JWT encryption
3. `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Must be set to the exact production URL (e.g., https://nikah-sufiyana-matrimonial.vercel.app)
4. `JWT_SECRET` - A secure random string for additional security (can be same as NEXTAUTH_SECRET)

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Visit `/api/auth/debug` to check session state and environment variables
2. Try `/auth-test` page which has a test login form
3. Clear cookies and try logging in again
4. Check Vercel function logs for errors
5. Verify cookie storage in browser dev tools (look for `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`)

## Session Process Flow

1. User registers → API creates user → NextAuth signIn called → sets cookies → redirects to dashboard
2. Cookie domain must match requesting domain
3. Middleware checks auth state via cookies
4. Protected routes check auth via getServerSession

## Callback URLs

- When using `signIn()`, always use full URLs for callbackUrl parameter
- Example: `new URL('/dashboard', window.location.origin).toString()`
