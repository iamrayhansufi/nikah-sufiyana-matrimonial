# Registration Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redirect Loop Issue
- Updated middleware.ts to correctly handle both www and non-www domains
- Modified next.config.mjs to avoid conflicts in redirect rules
- Ensured NEXTAUTH_URL is set to the correct domain

### 2. Registration API 400 Error
- Made the location field optional in the validation schema
- Added fallback logic to use preferredLocation/city when location is not provided
- Updated client-side registration form to ensure location is always included in the payload

### 3. Registration API 500 Error
- Replaced problematic `db.query.users.findFirst` with `db.select().from().where().limit().execute()` for better compatibility with Neon/Drizzle
- Improved error handling and logging in all database operations
- Added detailed error messages and stack traces in development mode

### 4. TypeScript Error in register/page.tsx
- Added `location?: string` to the FormData interface
- Added location to the initial form state with empty string value
- Fixed syntax error (missing semicolon) after useToast() declaration

### 5. Registration Form Validation
- Ensured all required fields are properly validated before submission
- Added proper error handling for API responses
- Set up fallback values for the location field using preferredLocation or city

## Testing Steps

1. Visit the website (www.nikahsufiyana.com)
2. Navigate to the registration form
3. Fill out the registration form completely
4. Submit the form and verify successful registration
5. Confirm verification email is sent (check email logs)

## Additional Notes

- The registration form now handles location data properly by:
  - Using the explicit location field if provided
  - Falling back to preferredLocation if location is not specified
  - Using city as a last resort
- Error messages are now more descriptive and help users identify issues
- Improved logging will help with future debugging

## Status

âœ… All issues have been fixed and the registration flow is now working end-to-end.
