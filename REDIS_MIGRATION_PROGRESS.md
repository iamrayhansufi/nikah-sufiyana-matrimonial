# Redis Migration Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Added Upstash Redis environment variables to `.env` file
   - Configured Redis URLs, tokens, and connection parameters

2. **Redis Client Implementation**:
   - Created `lib/redis-client.ts` with Redis connection setup
   - Implemented helper functions for all major data types:
     - Users
     - Profiles
     - Interests
     - Shortlists
     - Notifications

3. **Database Service Layer**:
   - Created unified database interface in `lib/database-service.ts`
   - Made Redis the primary database in the unified interface
   - Used the database service layer in API routes like `/api/profiles/search`

4. **Authentication Changes**:
   - Created Redis adapter for NextAuth in `lib/redis-adapter.ts`
   - Updated authentication options in `lib/auth-options-redis.ts`
   - Updated API route for NextAuth to use Redis

5. **Test Scripts**:
   - Created and tested `scripts/init-redis-with-sample-data.ts`
   - Created and tested `scripts/verify-redis-data.ts`
   - Verified successful data operations on all Redis tables

6. **Migration Script**:
   - Created `scripts/migrate-to-redis.ts` (fixed type issues)
   - Note: PostgreSQL connection has authentication issues, alternative approach needed

7. **Build Verification**:
   - Successfully built the application with Redis as primary database

## Pending Tasks

1. **API Routes Migration**:
   - 34 API routes still reference PostgreSQL directly
   - These routes need to be updated to use the unified database service

2. **Data Migration**:
   - Need alternative approach to migrate data from PostgreSQL (due to authentication issues)
   - Options:
     - Fix PostgreSQL authentication issues
     - Use database export/import approach
     - Manual data entry via admin interface

3. **Testing**:
   - Test all API endpoints with Redis
   - Verify all CRUD operations
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with Redis setup instructions
   - Document Redis schema structure
   - Update deployment guide for Redis

## Next Steps

1. Update the most critical API routes first:
   - Auth-related routes
   - User profile routes
   - Interest/shortlist routes

2. Create a testing plan to verify all features with Redis

3. Update any remaining UI components that might have direct database references

4. Once all endpoints use Redis, remove PostgreSQL dependencies from the project

## Redis Testing Status

- Connection: ✅ Working
- User Operations: ✅ Working
- Interest Operations: ✅ Working
- Shortlist Operations: ✅ Working
- Notification Operations: ✅ Working
- Authentication: ⏳ Partially Implemented
- API Integration: ⏳ In Progress
