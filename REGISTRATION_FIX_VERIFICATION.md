# Registration Fix Verification Guide

This guide will help you verify that all the registration flow issues have been fixed on the Nikah Sufiyana website after the recent updates.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the website (www.nikahsufiyana.com)
- Access to the email server logs or the ability to receive test registration emails
- Admin access to the database to verify user creation

## Step 1: Test Registration Flow

1. Open the website in your browser (www.nikahsufiyana.com)
2. Navigate to the registration page by clicking "Register" or going directly to /register
3. Try the registration process with the following test data:
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Gender: Male/Female (either)
   - Email: use a test email that you can access
   - Phone: use a valid phone number format with country code
   - Fill in all other required fields
4. Submit the registration form
5. Verify you are redirected to the verification page
6. Check that you receive a verification email with the OTP

## Step 2: Verify Database Entry

Using your database management tool (e.g., pgAdmin, SQL client):

1. Connect to your production database
2. Run a query to check if the test user was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'your_test_email@example.com';
   ```
3. Verify that all fields were correctly saved, particularly:
   - Location field has the correct value
   - Profile status is set to 'pending_verification'

## Step 3: Verify Email Verification

1. Get the verification code from the email
2. Enter it on the verification page
3. Confirm the account is activated
4. Try logging in with the new account

## Step 4: Edge Cases to Test

1. **Missing Location**: Try registration with the location field empty but preferred location filled
2. **Mobile Format**: Test with different country codes to ensure phone validation works correctly
3. **Already Registered Email**: Try registering with an existing email to confirm the error handling
4. **Already Registered Phone**: Try registering with an existing phone to confirm the error handling

## What Was Fixed

1. **TypeScript Error**: Fixed syntax error in register/page.tsx
2. **Location Field Handling**: Now uses preferredLocation or city as fallback if location is not explicitly set
3. **Database Query Method**: Replaced incompatible query method with a more compatible approach
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and logging
5. **Redirect Loop**: Fixed domain handling in middleware.ts and next.config.mjs
