# Middleware Authorization Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Identified
User `contact.rayhansufi@gmail.com` (ID: `user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn`) was being redirected to verify-email page because:
1. Session token showed `tokenVerified: false`
2. User was not actually verified in the database
3. Redis data had double prefix issues preventing proper data access

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Double Prefix Bug in Redis
- User data was stored with double prefix: `user:user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn`
- Database service expected single prefix: `user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn`
- This caused `database.users.getById()` to return null
- Session callback couldn't fetch fresh verification status

### 2. Incomplete User Data
- User had profile data but `verified: undefined` (not verified)
- This is correct behavior - user needs email verification
- Previous cleanup scripts missed some users due to double prefix issue

### 3. Users Set Inconsistency
- `users` set contained orphaned user IDs with no corresponding data
- This caused `findByEmail` method to fail when scanning through invalid users

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Double Prefix Issues
**Script**: `scripts/fix-all-double-prefixes.ts`
- Identified 7 users with double prefix keys (`user:user:*`)
- Moved all data to correct single prefix keys (`user:*`)
- Verified all users are now accessible via database service

### 2. Cleaned Up Users Set
**Script**: `scripts/cleanup-users-set.ts`
- Removed 5 orphaned user IDs from `users` set
- Ensured set only contains valid user IDs with actual data
- Fixed `findByEmail` method functionality

### 3. Enhanced Session Management
**Previous fixes**:
- Session callback now always checks fresh verification status
- JWT callback handles `updateSession()` triggers properly
- Custom refresh API provides fallback for session updates

## Current Status

### User: contact.rayhansufi@gmail.com
- **ID**: `user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn`
- **Status**: Unverified (correct)
- **Data**: Complete profile with 28 fields
- **Access**: Fully accessible via database service
- **Behavior**: Correctly redirected to verify-email (needs verification)

### All Users Summary
✅ **6/6 users** working correctly with database service:
- jane.smith@example.com - verified
- test.user@example.com - verified  
- contact.rayhansufi@gmail.com - **unverified**
- john.doe@example.com - verified
- test1@example.com - verified
- john.doe@example.com - verified (duplicate)

## Expected Behavior Now

### For contact.rayhansufi@gmail.com:
1. **Login attempt** → Middleware checks verification status
2. **Unverified user** → Redirected to `/verify-email` (correct)
3. **Email verification** → User enters OTP
4. **Verification success** → `verified: true` set in database
5. **Session refresh** → Session updated with verification status
6. **Access granted** → User can access dashboard

## Resolution Verification

### Middleware Logs Should Now Show:
```
Middleware Authorization Callback: {
  path: '/dashboard',
  hasToken: true,
  tokenId: 'user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn',
  tokenVerified: false  // Correct - user is unverified
}
```

### After Email Verification:
```
Middleware Authorization Callback: {
  path: '/dashboard',
  hasToken: true,
  tokenId: 'user:1750487572658-s0l035761sn',
  tokenVerified: true   // Updated after verification
}
```

## Files Fixed
- Fixed Redis double prefix issues across all users
- Cleaned up `users` set to remove orphaned IDs
- Enhanced session management (previous fixes)
- Improved database service reliability

## Next Steps for User
The user `contact.rayhansufi@gmail.com` should:
1. Go to `/verify-email` page
2. Enter the OTP sent to their email
3. Complete verification
4. Session will be updated automatically
5. Gain access to dashboard and all protected pages

The middleware redirect is now **working correctly** - unverified users should be redirected to verify-email, which is the expected security behavior.
