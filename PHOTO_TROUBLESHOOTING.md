# ðŸ”§ Photo Display Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
The profile photo keeps trying to load `/placeholder-user.jpg` and shows "Failed to load header profile image" errors continuously.

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to hard refresh
- Or open Developer Tools â†’ Application â†’ Storage â†’ Clear Storage

### 2. **Check Debug Endpoint**
Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/debug/photos` after logging in to see what's stored in database

### 3. **Upload a New Photo**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/edit-profile`
2. Upload a new photo
3. Check browser console for Cloudinary upload logs

## Expected Flow After Fix

### Before Upload:
- User sees User icon placeholder (no errors)
- No continuous error messages

### During Upload:
```
Uploading to Cloudinary...
Cloudinary upload successful: https://res.cloudinary.com/ddneah55w/image/upload/...
```

### After Upload:
- Photo displays immediately from Cloudinary URL
- No more placeholder errors
- Image loads fast from CDN

## Debugging Commands

### Check what's in database:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/debug-photos.ts
```

### Test Cloudinary connection:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-cloudinary.ts
```

## What We Fixed

âœ… **Cloudinary Integration**: Photos now upload to cloud storage  
âœ… **Database Storage**: URLs stored instead of base64 data  
âœ… **Performance**: Images load from CDN  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Better fallback logic  
âœ… **Infinite Loop**: Prevented with src checking  

## Next Steps

1. Try uploading a photo
2. Check if it appears in Cloudinary dashboard
3. Verify the photo displays correctly
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

If issues persist, the debug endpoint will show us exactly what's stored in the database.
