# Send Interest Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive "Send Interest" functionality with photo access controls similar to Instagram's private account system. The implementation includes privacy controls, time-based photo access, and the ability to revoke access.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Send Interest Functionality
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/profiles/send-interest`
- Users can send interest requests to other profiles
- Prevents duplicate interest requests (unless previously declined)
- Sends notifications and email alerts to the receiver
- Includes sender profile validation

### 2. Respond to Interest Functionality
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/profiles/respond-interest`
- Users can accept or decline interest requests
- **Photo Access Duration Selection**: When accepting, users can choose:
  - 1 day
  - 2 days
  - 1 week
  - 1 month
  - Permanent access
- Sends notifications and emails to the sender with access duration info

### 3. Photo Access Control System
- **Check Access API**: `/api/profiles/check-photo-access`
- **Revoke Access API**: `/api/profiles/revoke-photo-access`
- **List Access API**: `/api/profiles/photo-access-list`
- Time-based access control with automatic expiry
- Manual revocation capability
- Real-time access status checking

### 4. Enhanced Profile Viewing
- **Profile Page**: `/profile/[id]`
- Photos are blurred by default for privacy
- Shows Islamic-themed privacy overlay
- Displays photo access status and remaining time
- Quick interest response buttons directly on profile
- Photo access information cards

### 5. Dashboard Privacy Management
- **Dashboard Tab**: "Privacy" tab in user dashboard
- **PhotoAccessManager Component**: Manage who has photo access
- View all users with current photo access
- Revoke access with confirmation dialog
- Real-time remaining time display

### 6. UI Components
- **InterestResponseDialog**: Modal for accepting/declining with duration selection
- **QuickInterestResponse**: Quick response buttons for profile pages
- **PhotoAccessManager**: Dashboard component for managing access

## Technical Implementation

### Backend APIs
1. **Send Interest** (`/api/profiles/send-interest`)
   - Validates sender profile completeness
   - Prevents duplicate requests
   - Creates interest record in Redis
   - Sends notifications and emails

2. **Respond Interest** (`/api/profiles/respond-interest`)
   - Accepts `photoAccessDuration` parameter
   - Calculates expiry dates
   - Updates interest with access information
   - Sends detailed response emails

3. **Check Photo Access** (`/api/profiles/check-photo-access`)
   - Validates current user's access to a profile's photos
   - Checks for expiry and revocation status
   - Returns remaining time information

4. **Revoke Photo Access** (`/api/profiles/revoke-photo-access`)
   - Allows photo access revoking
   - Sends notification to affected user
   - Updates interest record

5. **Photo Access List** (`/api/profiles/photo-access-list`)
   - Returns list of users with current photo access
   - Calculates remaining time for each access
   - Excludes expired access

### Frontend Components
1. **Profile Page Enhancements**
   - Integrated photo access checking
   - Visual indicators for access status
   - Interest response handling
   - Time-based photo visibility

2. **Dashboard Privacy Tab**
   - Comprehensive photo access management
   - Real-time access status updates
   - Easy revocation interface

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Enhanced interest response emails
   - Photo access duration information
   - Professional Islamic-themed design

## Data Structure

### Interest Record (Redis)
```typescript
interface RedisInterest {
  id: string;
  senderId: string;
  receiverId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined';
  message: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  photoAccessDuration?: '1day' | '2days' | '1week' | '1month' | 'permanent';
  photoAccessExpiryDate?: string;
  photoAccessGrantedAt?: string;
  photoAccessRevoked?: 'true' | 'false';
  photoAccessRevokedAt?: string;
}
```

## User Flow

### Sending Interest
1. User A visits User B's profile
2. User A clicks "Send Interest"
3. System validates and creates interest record
4. User B receives notification and email
5. User B can accept/decline from profile or dashboard

### Accepting Interest
1. User B sees interest request on User A's profile
2. User B clicks "Accept" and selects photo access duration
3. System grants photo access with expiry
4. User A receives notification with access details
5. User A can now view User B's photos for the specified duration

### Photo Access Management
1. User B can view all granted photo access in dashboard
2. User B can revoke access at any time
3. System automatically hides photos after expiry
4. User A receives notification when access is revoked

## Privacy Features

### Islamic Values Integration
- Respectful privacy controls
- Haya (modesty) principle implementation
- Islamic-themed UI messages
- Gradual relationship building approach

### Photo Visibility Logic
- Default: Photos are private (blurred)
- Visibility requires accepted interest
- Time-based access control
- Instant revocation capability
- Automatic expiry handling

## Email Templates
- **Interest Received**: Notifies when someone sends interest
- **Interest Response**: Detailed acceptance/decline notifications
- **Photo Access**: Clear information about access duration
- **Islamic Branding**: Consistent with site's Islamic theme

## Security Considerations
- Session-based authentication
- User authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for interest requests
- Secure photo access verification

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test interest sending/receiving flow
2. Verify photo access duration calculations
3. Test automatic expiry functionality
4. Verify revocation works correctly
5. Test email notifications
6. Test UI responsiveness
7. Verify Islamic-themed messaging

## Future Enhancements
1. Photo access extension requests
2. Bulk access management
3. Access history tracking
4. Advanced privacy settings
5. Photo watermarking
6. Access analytics

The implementation successfully provides a comprehensive privacy-focused interest system that respects Islamic values while providing modern social features.
