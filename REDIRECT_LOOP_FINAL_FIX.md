# Complete Solution to Fix Redirect Loop on www.nikahsufiyana.com

## What We Just Fixed

Your website was experiencing a redirect loop on www.nikahsufiyana.com even after you updated the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable. This was happening because:

1. The middleware.ts file was still configured to redirect domains that didn't exactly match the expected domain
2. There was likely a conflict between your domain setup and what the middleware was expecting

## The Solution I Applied

1. **Completely disabled domain redirects in middleware.ts**:
   - Changed the expected domain to 'www.nikahsufiyana.com' to match your new NEXTAUTH_URL
   - Removed the redirect logic that was causing the loop
   - This allows any domain to work, including both www and non-www versions

2. **Next steps after deployment**:
   - After deploying these changes, the redirect loop should be fixed
   - You can then gradually re-enable domain validation once the site is stable

## Important Production Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://www.nikahsufiyana.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[your-secret-value]
```

## Verifying the Fix Works

After deploying these changes:

1. Visit https://www.nikahsufiyana.com in a private/incognito browser window
2. Check if the site loads without the redirect loop error
3. Try accessing the dashboard and protected pages if you're logged in
4. Try the login process to ensure authentication works

## If Problems Persist

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Clear all site data/cookies**: In your browser settings, clear all cookies and site data for nikahsufiyana.com
2. **Check Vercel logs**: Look for any errors in the Vercel function logs
3. **DNS propagation**: Sometimes DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
4. **Cookie domains**: Ensure any cookies are being set for the correct domain

## Long-term Solution

Once everything is working:

1. Decide on your preferred canonical domain (www or non-www)
2. Update the middleware.ts file to enforce that canonical domain
3. Update DNS settings to match your preference
4. Update all NEXTAUTH_URL references to use your preferred domain

This approach completely disables domain redirects, which eliminates the redirect loop. After confirming everything works, you can gradually reintroduce domain validation in a controlled manner.
