# Photo Deletion Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
The user reported that photo deletion was not working - photos would appear to be deleted in the UI but would reappear after page refresh or when attempting to delete them again.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Results
1. **Backend Deletion API**: ✅ Working correctly
   - The DELETE `/api/profiles/delete-photo` endpoint was successfully removing photos from Redis
   - All Redis operations (HSET, filtering, JSON serialization) were functioning properly
   - Verification scripts confirmed photos were actually being deleted from the database

2. **Frontend Issues**: ❌ Caching and timing problems
   - Browser/frontend caching was showing stale data after deletion
   - Race condition between deletion API call and profile refetch
   - Insufficient cache-busting in profile data requests

### Evidence
- **Before fix**: User had 3 photos in Redis
- **After deletion**: User correctly had 2 photos in Redis (verified via multiple scripts)
- **Frontend showed**: Still displaying 3 photos due to caching issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Refetch with Cache Busting
```typescript
// Added timestamp and stronger cache-busting headers
const timestamp = Date.now();
const response = await fetch(`/api/profiles/${session.user.id}?t=${timestamp}`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate",
    "Pragma": "no-cache", 
    "Expires": "0"
  },
  cache: 'no-store'
});
```

### 2. Improved Deletion Flow with Retry Logic
```typescript
// Added delay and retry mechanism
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));

let attempts = 0;
const maxAttempts = 3;
let currentPhotoCount = profileData?.profilePhotos?.length || 0;

while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
  await refetchProfile();
  const newPhotoCount = profileData?.profilePhotos?.length || 0;
  
  if (newPhotoCount < currentPhotoCount) {
    console.log("✅ Photo count decreased, deletion successful!");
    break;
  }
  
  attempts++;
  if (attempts < maxAttempts) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); 
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the deletion process
- Backend API now logs every step of the deletion operation
- Frontend logs before/after states and retry attempts

## Testing Verification

### Scripts Created
1. `check-specific-user-fixed.ts` - Verify current photo state in Redis
2. `simulate-deletion.ts` - Test the exact deletion logic
3. `test-database-service-photos.ts` - Verify database service returns correct data

### Test Results
- ✅ Redis deletion: Working correctly
- ✅ Database service: Returns updated photo count
- ✅ Backend API: Properly processes deletion requests
- ✅ Frontend improvements: Should now handle caching issues

## Files Modified
1. `app/edit-profile/page.tsx` - Enhanced deletion flow and cache busting
2. `app/api/profiles/delete-photo/route.ts` - Added comprehensive logging

## Expected Outcome
- Photos should now be deleted immediately and persistently
- UI should reflect changes without requiring page refresh
- No more "ghost" photos that reappear after deletion
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to edit-profile page
2. Upload multiple photos to test with
3. Delete a photo from the gallery
4. Wait for success message
5. Verify photo is removed from UI immediately
6. Refresh page to confirm deletion persisted
7. Check browser console for detailed logs if issues occur

## Monitoring
The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues:
- Backend: Watch for HSET results and verification steps
- Frontend: Monitor photo count changes and retry attempts
- Look for "✅ Photo count decreased, deletion successful!" message
