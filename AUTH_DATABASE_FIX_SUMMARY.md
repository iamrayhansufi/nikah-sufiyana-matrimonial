# Authentication Database Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The authentication system was failing with the following error:
```
Error [NeonDbError]: column "role" does not exist
```

This occurred because:
1. The users table schema in `src/db/schema.ts` includes a `role` column (line 8)
2. The migration file `drizzle/0001_add_user_role.sql` exists to add this column
3. However, the migration was never applied to the production database
4. The authentication code was trying to select ALL columns from users, including the missing `role` column

## Immediate Fix Applied ✅

**Modified:** `lib/auth-options.ts`
- Changed the database query from `db.select().from(users)` to `db.select(selectColumns).from(users)`
- Explicitly selected only existing columns to avoid the missing `role` column
- Temporarily defaulted user role to 'user' instead of reading from database
- This allows authentication to work while the database migration is pending

## Result
✅ Authentication error resolved
✅ Development server starts successfully  
✅ Users can now log in without database errors

## Next Steps (TO DO)

### 1. Complete Database Migration
Run one of these commands to add the role column:
```bash
npm run db:push        # Recommended - pushes current schema
# OR
npm run db:migrate     # Runs pending migrations
```

### 2. Restore Full Role Functionality
After the migration completes successfully:
```bash
node restore-role-functionality.js
```

This will:
- Restore the original database query to select all columns
- Enable role-based functionality in authentication
- Allow proper user role management

### 3. Verify the Fix
1. Test login functionality
2. Check that user roles are properly assigned
3. Verify admin users have correct permissions

## Files Created/Modified

**Modified:**
- `lib/auth-options.ts` - Fixed database query to avoid missing column

**Created:**
- `fix-role-column.js` - Script to manually add role column
- `add-role-column.js` - Alternative script for adding role column
- `check-users-table.js` - Script to check database table structure
- `restore-role-functionality.js` - Script to restore full role functionality

## Technical Details

**Schema Definition (Correct):**
```typescript
role: varchar('role', { length: 20 }).notNull().default('user'),
```

**Migration SQL (Exists):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "role" varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user';
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON "users" ("role");
```

The fix ensures the application works while maintaining data integrity and user security.
