# Redis Migration Completion Report

## Migration Overview

The matrimonial application has been successfully migrated from PostgreSQL/Drizzle/Neon to Upstash Redis as the primary database. This migration has been completed with all core features preserved and functioning properly.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Updated `.env` to use Redis configuration
   - Commented out legacy PostgreSQL connection strings
   - Added `DATABASE_TYPE="redis"` environment variable

2. **Redis Implementation**
   - Created and tested Redis client (`lib/redis-client.ts`)
   - Implemented Redis adapter for authentication (`lib/redis-adapter.ts`)
   - Created Redis-based verification module (`lib/verification-redis.ts`)
   - Updated database service layer to use Redis exclusively (`lib/database-service.ts`)

3. **Data Migration**
   - Created scripts to initialize Redis with sample data
   - Developed and ran migration script to transfer data from JSON backup to Redis
   - Verified data integrity in Redis

4. **API Routes Update**
   - Updated all critical API routes to use Redis:
     - Authentication routes (`/api/auth/*`)
     - User profile routes (`/api/profiles/*`)
     - Interest management routes
     - Notification routes
     - Verification routes

5. **Code Cleanup**
   - Archived/removed PostgreSQL schema files
   - Archived/removed Drizzle migration files
   - Removed PostgreSQL/Drizzle/Neon dependencies
   - Created backup of PostgreSQL-related code for future reference

6. **Testing**
   - Created test scripts to verify Redis operations
   - Tested authentication flow
   - Tested interest management
   - Tested profile updates and searches
   - Verified OTP/verification functionality

## Technical Details

### Redis Data Structure

The application now uses Redis with the following key patterns:

- User data: `user:{userId}` (hash)
- User index: `users` (set)
- Profile data: `profile:{profileId}` (hash)
- Interest data: `interest:{interestId}` (hash)
- Interest indexes: `user:{userId}:interests:sent` and `user:{userId}:interests:received` (sets)
- Shortlist data: `user:{userId}:shortlist` (set)
- Notification data: `notification:{notificationId}` (hash)
- Notification index: `user:{userId}:notifications` (set)
- Verification codes: `verification:{email}:{purpose}` (hash)

### Updated Dependencies

- Added: `@upstash/redis`
- Removed: `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `postgres`, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor Redis performance and connection pool usage
   - Optimize queries and data access patterns if necessary

2. **Data Backup Strategy**
   - Implement regular backup of Redis data
   - Document disaster recovery procedures

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed profiles
   - Optimize search functionality using Redis search capabilities
   - Consider Redis Streams for real-time messaging

## Conclusion

The migration to Redis has been completed successfully. The application is now using Redis exclusively for all database operations. The Redis implementation provides better scalability, simpler deployment, and more cost-effective operation for this application's workload.
